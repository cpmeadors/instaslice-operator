If something changes with how the operator is built, Dockerfile.ocp may also needs to be updated.

Modify Dockerfile.ocp

Make sure the image builds with
docker build -f Dockerfile.ocp


If something changes that affects the bundle, the ocp bundle needs to be regenerated.

Update the version is necessary
export VERSION=0.1.0

Set the image urls for the offical repos
export IMG=registry.redhat.io/dynamic-accelerator-slicer-tech-preview/instaslice-rhel9-operator:$VERSION
export IMG_DMST=registry.redhat.io/dynamic-accelerator-slicer-tech-preview/instaslice-daemonset-rhel9:$VERSION

Regenerate the bundle
make bundle-ocp

Konflux CI with build the images to catch errors.  In the future, Konflux integration tests will test images for PRs as a set to verify images urls are correct.
